DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION
=======================

  First I created a HTML file and a folder for the CSS files.
  The CSS rules are divided into 4 parts in the css folder.
    - normalize.min.css for the CSS reset
    - basic.css, for the global CSS rules
    - layout.css, for the CSS rules of the layout
    - component.css, the CSS rules for the components that build up the page
